# VBA Challenge Readme

This project was created for the 2023 UTSA Data Analytics Bootcap

The Multiple_year_stock_data_final sheet contains the finished solution for the VBA challenge assignment

Within the repo, is a Zip file named "VBA Challenge" that contains
-A seperate VBA file of the script used
-Screenshots of the finished product
-README file

During the completion of this project I referenced UTSA Data Analytics class resources, as well as other GitHub projects that can be found at these links:
